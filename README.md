# 💻 MERN_STACK – Node.js Practice

This repository is a part of my MERN Stack learning journey, starting with **Node.js**.

Here, I document all my practice files, mini-projects, and learning notes as I understand the fundamentals of Node.js backend development.

---

## 📦 What I’ve Practiced So Far

- Using require() to import modules
- Using module.exports to export data from files
- Creating and using JavaScript objects
- Running Node.js files through the terminal

---

## 🧪 Example Covered

A simple object named "riya" is created with details like name, favorite number, and developer status. This object is exported from one file and imported into another using `require()`. The object is then printed along with a greeting message.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

To run any file:
1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the file using `node filename.js`

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- index.js – main file that uses imported code
- second.js – file exporting a sample object
- package.json – project configuration
- package-lock.json – version lock for dependencies
- .gitignore – to exclude node_modules from GitHub

---

## 🔒 GitHub Notes

- node_modules is intentionally excluded from version control using `.gitignore`
- Only source files and configuration files are pushed

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm Riya Singh, a CSE undergraduate passionate about backend and full-stack web development. This Node.js folder is my first step into the MERN Stack journey. Stay tuned as I update this repository with more concepts and projects.
